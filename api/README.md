Vercel uses all javascript files in the /api/ directory to generate serverless functions as a shallow stand-in for a proper server
Basically the api folder is our server

From the docs:
Vercel Serverless Functions enable running code on-demand without needing to manage your own infrastructure, provision servers, or upgrade hardware.
